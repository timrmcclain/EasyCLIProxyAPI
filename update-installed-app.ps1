# Updates the installed Tim's AI Hub GUI in place, the same way the existing
# EasyCLIProxyAPI-backups/*/ snapshots suggest this has been done before: stop
# the GUI, back up its current exe, copy in the freshly built one, and
# relaunch -- back up and swap EasyCLIProxyAPI.exe ONLY.
#
# cli-proxy-api.exe (the actual proxy serving 127.0.0.1:8317) is left running
# throughout. The GUI and proxy are independent processes now (see
# core_runtime.rs: the proxy is no longer tied to the GUI's lifetime), and the
# GUI re-adopts the still-running proxy on relaunch instead of starting a
# duplicate -- so this script does NOT touch cli-proxy-api.exe, and anything
# depending on the proxy (e.g. Claude Desktop's third-party inference) is
# never interrupted by a GUI update.
#
# This only updates the GUI. If you ever need to update the proxy/kernel
# itself (a new CPA core version, not just this app's UI), that's a separate,
# genuinely disruptive operation -- not what this script does.
#
# Prerequisite: build first, e.g. from a 'Developer PowerShell' / terminal
# with cargo and bun on PATH:
#   bun tauri build --no-bundle
# (the GUI-only build; the NSIS installer isn't used for this flow since it
# can't tell personal-desk.N builds apart -- see below.)
